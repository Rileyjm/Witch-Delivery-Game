Brainshroom caps are all wrinkly and gross-looking, but they taste really good. I think I remember my great-aunt saying she found Brainshrooms in the swamp sometimes.
Sometimes I wonder if looking-grass really is looking at me. When my great-aunt sent me to pick looking-grass stalks, I’d wash them off in the lake so their eyes would close
The rootbulb looks like it smells terrible, but it’s hard to tell when surrounded by swamp fumes
Once I made the mistake of picking up a rootbulb with my bare hands. I had acid burns for weeks
