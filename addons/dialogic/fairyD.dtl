The Chaos Flower can be found in the forest. There may be some obstacles there, but you can use spells to get past them.
The Snowdrop flower and the Light Fruit can be found in the mountains. I have not been there myself, but I have heard it can be dangerous, so please be careful.
Many humans have gotten lost in these mountains. Sadly, the Light Fruit may be hiding deep in the mountains among many dangers.
